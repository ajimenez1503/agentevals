`agentevals` scores agent behavior from OpenTelemetry traces without re-running the agent. It parses OTLP streams and Jaeger JSON traces, then evaluates them against golden eval sets using ADK's evaluation framework.

Ships as a **CLI** for scripting and CI, a **web UI** for visual inspection and interactive evaluation, and an **MCP server** so Claude Code can run evaluations directly from a conversation.

## Installation

Download a release wheel from the [releases page](../../releases):

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **core** | CLI + REST API, batch evaluation only |
| **bundle** | CLI + REST API + Streaming + embedded web UI |

```bash
pip install agentevals-<version>-py3-none-any.whl

# For MCP server support:
pip install "agentevals-<version>-py3-none-any.whl[live]"
```

**From source** with `uv` or Nix:

```bash
uv sync              
# or: nix develop .
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for build instructions.

## Quick Start

Run an evaluation against a sample trace:

```bash
uv run agentevals run samples/helm.json \
  --eval-set samples/eval_set_helm.json \
  -m tool_trajectory_avg_score
```

List available metrics:

```bash
uv run agentevals list-metrics
```

## Integration

### Zero-Code (Recommended)

Point any OTel-instrumented agent at the receiver. No SDK, no code changes:

```bash
# Terminal 1
uv run agentevals serve --dev

# Terminal 2
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="agentevals.session_name=my-agent"
python your_agent.py
```

Traces stream to the UI in real-time. Works with LangChain, Strands, Google ADK, or any framework that emits OTel spans (`http/protobuf` and `http/json` supported). Sessions are auto-created and grouped by `agentevals.session_name`. Set `agentevals.eval_set_id` to associate traces with an eval set.

See [examples/zero-code-examples/](examples/zero-code-examples/) for working examples.

### SDK

For programmatic session lifecycle and decorator API:

```python
from agentevals import AgentEvals

app = AgentEvals()

with app.session(eval_set_id="my-eval"):
    agent.invoke("Roll a 20-sided die for me")
```

Requires `pip install "agentevals[streaming]"`. See [examples/sdk_example/](examples/sdk_example/) for framework-specific patterns.

## CLI

```bash
# Single trace
uv run agentevals run samples/helm.json \
  --eval-set samples/eval_set_helm.json \
  -m tool_trajectory_avg_score

# Multiple traces
uv run agentevals run samples/helm.json samples/k8s.json \
  --eval-set samples/eval_set_helm.json \
  -m tool_trajectory_avg_score

# JSON output
uv run agentevals run samples/helm.json \
  --eval-set samples/eval_set_helm.json \
  --output json
```

## Custom Evaluators

Beyond the built-in metrics, you can write your own evaluators in Python, JavaScript, or any language. An evaluator is any program that reads JSON from stdin and writes a score to stdout.

```bash
agentevals evaluator init my_evaluator
```

This scaffolds a directory with boilerplate and a manifest. Implement your scoring logic, then reference it in an eval config:

```yaml
# eval_config.yaml
evaluators:
  - name: tool_trajectory_avg_score
    type: builtin

  - name: my_evaluator
    type: code
    path: ./evaluators/my_evaluator.py
    threshold: 0.7
```

```bash
agentevals run trace.json --config eval_config.yaml --eval-set eval_set.json
```

Community evaluators can be referenced directly from a shared GitHub repository using `type: remote`. See the [Custom Evaluators guide](docs/custom-evaluators.md) for the full protocol reference, SDK usage, and how to contribute evaluators.

## Web UI

**Installed bundle** (port 8001):

```bash
agentevals serve
```

**From source** (two terminals):

```bash
uv run agentevals serve --dev    # Terminal 1
cd ui && npm install && npm run dev             # Terminal 2 → http://localhost:5173
```

Upload traces and eval sets, select metrics, and view results with interactive span trees. Live-streamed traces appear in the "Local Dev" tab, grouped by session ID.

## REST API Reference

While the server is running, interactive API documentation is available at:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [`/docs`](http://localhost:8001/docs) | Swagger UI with interactive request builder |
| [`/redoc`](http://localhost:8001/redoc) | ReDoc reference documentation |
| [`/openapi.json`](http://localhost:8001/openapi.json) | Raw OpenAPI 3.x schema (for code generation or CI) |

The OTLP receiver (port 4318) serves its own docs at `http://localhost:4318/docs`.

## MCP Server

Exposes evaluation tools to MCP clients. A `.mcp.json` at the project root lets Claude Code pick it up automatically.

| Tool | Requires `serve` | Description |
|------|:---:|-------------|
| `list_metrics` | yes | List available metrics |
| `evaluate_traces` | no | Evaluate local trace files (OTLP or Jaeger) |
| `list_sessions` | yes | List streaming sessions |
| `summarize_session` | yes | Structured summary of a session's tool calls |
| `evaluate_sessions` | yes | Evaluate sessions against a golden reference |

```bash
# Custom server URL
AGENTEVALS_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:9000 uv run agentevals mcp
```

The React UI and MCP server share the same in-memory session state and can run simultaneously.

## Claude Code Skills

Two slash-command workflows in `.claude/skills/`, available automatically in this repo:

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/eval` | Score traces or compare sessions against a golden reference |
| `/inspect` | Turn-by-turn narrative of a live session with anomaly detection |

## Docs

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Eval Set Format](docs/eval-set-format.md) | Schema, field reference, and examples for golden eval set JSON files |
| [Custom Evaluators](docs/custom-evaluators.md) | Write your own scoring logic in Python, JavaScript, or any language |
| [OpenTelemetry Compatibility](docs/otel-compatibility.md) | Supported OTel conventions, message delivery mechanisms, and OTLP receiver |

## Development

```bash
uv run pytest                      # run tests
uv run agentevals serve --dev      # backend
cd ui && npm run dev               # frontend (separate terminal)
```

## FAQ

**How does this compare to ADK's evaluations?**
Unlike ADK's LocalEvalService, which couples agent execution with evaluation, agentevals only handles scoring: it takes pre-recorded traces and compares them against expected behavior using metrics like tool trajectory matching, response quality, and LLM-based judgments.

However, if you're iterating on your agents locally, you can point your agents to agentevals and you will see rich runtime information in your browser. For more details, use the bundled wheel and explore the Local Development option in the UI.

**How does this compare to Bedrock AgentCore's evaluation?**
AgentCore's evaluation integration (via `strands-agents-evals`) also couples agent execution with evaluation. It re-invokes the agent for each test case, converts the resulting OTel spans to AWS's ADOT format, and scores them against 4 built-in evaluators (Helpfulness, Accuracy, Harmfulness, Relevance) via a cloud API call. This means you need an AWS account, valid credentials, and network access for every evaluation.

agentevals takes a different approach: it scores pre-recorded traces locally without re-running anything. It works with standard Jaeger JSON and OTLP formats from any framework, supports open-ended metrics (tool trajectory matching, LLM-based judges, custom scorers), and ships with a CLI, web UI, and MCP server. No cloud dependency required, though we do include all ADK's GCP-based evals as of now.
